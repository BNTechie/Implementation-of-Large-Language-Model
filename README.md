# Large Language Models (LLM) 
This repository provides a step-by-step guide to setting up an environment for working with large language models (LLMs) using Hugging Face's Transformers library. The tutorial covers generating text with GPT-2, fine-tuning a BERT model for sentiment analysis, and deploying the fine-tuned model.

GPT-2 model can be used to generate text. The GPT-2 model is pre-trained and can generate coherent and contextually relevant text based on a given prompt.

 ### Fine-Tuning BERT for Sentiment Analysis

This involves:

##### Loading and preprocessing a dataset (e.g., IMDB reviews).
##### Preparing the data for training using tokenizers and data collators.
##### Fine-tuning the BERT model with the prepared dataset.
##### Evaluating the fine-tuned model to check its performance.
##### Deploying the Model

After fine-tuning, the model can be saved and deployed for real-time use. The tutorial demonstrates how to save the model and load it for inference to perform tasks like sentiment analysis on new text inputs.
